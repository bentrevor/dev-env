##Intro##
This is a set of color schemes for iTerm (aka iTerm2). Screenshots in the [screenshots](screenshots/) directory and in `screenshots.markdown`.

##Installation Instructions##

* Type CMD+i (âŒ˜+i)
* Navigate to Colors tab
* Click on Load Presets

* Click on Load Presets and choose a color scheme

## Credits
See `credits.txt`.

##Terminal color schemes##
Just double click on selected theme in `terminal` directory

##Previewing color schemes##

[preview.rb](tools/preview.rb) is a simple script that allows you to preview
the color schemes without having to import them. It parses .itermcolors files
and applies the colors to the current session using [iTerm's proprietary
escape codes](https://iterm2.com/documentation-escape-codes.html). As noted in
the linked page, it doesn't run on tmux or screen.

```sh
# Apply AdventureTime scheme to the current session
tools/preview.rb schemes/AdventureTime.itermcolors

# Apply the schemes in turn.
# - Press any key to advance; hit CTRL-C or ESC to stop
tools/preview.rb schemes/*
```
